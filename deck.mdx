> Storybook runs outside of your app. So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook

> Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.
